# Use-C-to-create-a-small-game
My own experience in making two small C code games.

  During the start of December, two projects made me mad and took up most of my time.~~:joy:~~ 
  However, I think I have learnt much from the experience, for we must write countless project later,
so I think I should write down something useful or interesting in the process, so that I can look up it quickly months later.
